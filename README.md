## Requirements
* Xcode 5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 7.0 or higher
* ARC

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `WMGaugeView` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.28.0** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add WMGaugeView:

``` bash
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'WMGaugeView'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `WMGaugeView` files into your project, and add `#include "WMGaugeView.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
gaugeView.style = [WMGaugeViewStyleFlatThin new];
gaugeView.maxValue = 100.0;
gaugeView.scaleDivisions = 10;
gaugeView.scaleSubdivisions = 5;
gaugeView.scaleStartAngle = 30;
gaugeView.scaleEndAngle = 280;
gaugeView.showScaleShadow = NO;
gaugeView.scaleFont = [UIFont fontWithName:@"AvenirNext-UltraLight" size:0.065];
gaugeView.scalesubdivisionsaligment = WMGaugeViewSubdivisionsAlignmentCenter;
gaugeView.scaleSubdivisionsWidth = 0.002;
gaugeView.scaleSubdivisionsLength = 0.04;
gaugeView.scaleDivisionsWidth = 0.007;
gaugeView.scaleDivisionsLength = 0.07;

[gaugeView setValue:56.2 animated:YES duration:1.6 completion:^(BOOL finished) {
  NSLog(@"gaugeView animation complete");
}];
```

## Customization

You can customize the following properties of `WMGaugeView`:

``` objective-c
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) bool showInnerBackground;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) bool showInnerRim;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat innerRimWidth;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat innerRimBorderWidth;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scalePosition;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleStartAngle;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleEndAngle;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleDivisions;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleSubdivisions;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) bool showScaleShadow;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) WMGaugeViewSubdivisionsAlignment scalesubdivisionsaligment;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleDivisionsLength;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleDivisionsWidth;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleSubdivisionsLength;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat scaleSubdivisionsWidth;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIColor *scaleDivisionColor;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIColor *scaleSubDivisionColor;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIFont *scaleFont;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) float value;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) float minValue;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) float maxValue;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) bool showRangeLabels;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat rangeLabelsWidth;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIFont *rangeLabelsFont;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIColor *rangeLabelsFontColor;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat rangeLabelsFontKerning;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) NSArray *rangeValues;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) NSArray *rangeColors;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) NSArray *rangeLabels;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIColor *unitOfMeasurementColor;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) CGFloat unitOfMeasurementVerticalOffset;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) UIFont *unitOfMeasurementFont;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) NSString *unitOfMeasurement;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) bool showUnitOfMeasurement;
```

Drawing is handled by style protocols in order to provide easy customization of background and needle :
``` objective-c
@protocol WMGaugeViewStyle <NSObject>
@required
- (void)drawNeedleOnLayer:(CALayer*)layer inRect:(CGRect)rect;
- (void)drawFaceWithContext:(CGContextRef)context inRect:(CGRect)rect;
- (BOOL)needleLayer:(CALayer*)layer willMoveAnimated:(BOOL)animated duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration animation:(CAKeyframeAnimation*)animation;

@end
```
